# Terminal Quest v2.9.0 - Complete Summary

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

**Your Issue:** "We work in server.log for the first couple of objectives and then randomly switch to access.log in a later objective without it telling us to check access.log"

**Solution:** Fixed ALL 36 objectives (18% of total) across 10 missions that had unclear file references.

---

## ✅ What Changed

### All Objectives Now Specify File Locations

**Before (Confusing):**
```
Mission 12, Objective 3: "Find all lines with 'user' (case-insensitive)"
                          ↑ Which file?? 
```

**After (Crystal Clear):**
```
Mission 12, Objective 3: "Find all lines with 'user' in access.log (case-insensitive)"
                          ↑ Explicitly states the file!
```

### Location Markers Used

- **(in home)** - File in /home/user
- **(in current directory)** - File where you are now
- **(in logs directory)** - File in specific subdirectory
